# Hello COBOL

While going through my daily routine of digging through the tech links I stumbled upon this video: [COBOL Course - Programming with VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdMAEdGvtLA)... and since my knowledge of COBOL was mostly based on jokes or anecdotes I thouht to myself "sure, I can spend an hour and seventeen minutes of my time to learn something and perhaps be less biased about one of the most famous programming languages in the world". 

Oh little did I know what a rabbit hole this was...
